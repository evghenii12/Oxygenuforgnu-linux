# Oxygenuforgnu-linux
Oxygen u ported for gnu linux. This also works on windows 10,11 and probably on windows 7.
This works with grapejuice.
Feel free to modify this , but will be good if you credit me.

To launch this u need to click on wine apps after taskmgr in taskmgr click file and run after browse and select executor exe file(in grapejuice app)

If something don't work u can tell me in issues.
